## 2. The "Why" — The Problem Reimagined

### Section Title
**When Fields Burn, Cities Choke**

### Copy

Every autumn, the air quality index in North India doesn't just rise—it suffocates. Farmers burn 23 million tonnes of stubble because there's no economic alternative. The smoke travels hundreds of kilometers, turning skies grey and lungs heavy.

**But here's the truth we choose to see:**  
This isn't just waste. It's raw material waiting for purpose.

### Visual Element
- Split-screen comparison: Left side shows hazy cityscape (AQI 400+), right side shows a clean, minimalist product shot
- Subtle animation: smoke transitioning into product texture

### Stats (Minimal, Impactful)
- **23M tonnes** of agricultural waste burned annually
- **AQI 400+** in Delhi-NCR during harvest season
- **₹0** value for farmers in stubble—until now

## 3. The "How" — From Farm to Table

### Section Title
**Engineered from Earth**

### Copy

We don't just recycle. We reimagine.

**Step 1: Sourcing**  
We partner directly with farmers in Punjab and Haryana, purchasing stubble that would otherwise be burned. For them, it's income. For us, it's the foundation.

**Step 2: Engineering**  
Through proprietary bio-composite technology, we transform crop residue into a durable, heat-resistant, food-safe material. This isn't craft—it's precision engineering.

**Step 3: Crafting**  
Each product is molded, finished, and textured to reveal the natural grain of the straw. No two pieces are identical. Every item carries the fingerprint of the field it came from.

**Step 4: Your Table**  
What arrives at your cafe, hotel, or home isn't just a product. It's a story. A conversation starter. A quiet rebellion against waste.

### Visual Flow
- Illustrated/animated journey: Field → Lab → Workshop → Table
- Use warm, earthy tones with clean, modern iconography
- Show hands (farmer's hands, engineer's hands, barista's hands) to humanize the process

## 5. Founder Story — The Unlikely Engineers

### Section Title
**Two Engineers. One Hardware Problem.**

### Copy

We're Vedant and Parth—computer science graduates who spent more time in code editors than workshops. But when we saw the stubble burning crisis up close, we realized this wasn't a policy problem or an awareness problem.

**It was an engineering problem.**

Farmers don't burn stubble because they want to. They burn it because:  
1. Removing it manually is expensive  
2. Leaving it delays the next crop  
3. There's no market for it  

So we asked: *What if stubble had value?*

Not as compost. Not as fuel. But as **material**.

We spent 18 months in trial and error—testing binders, heat resistance, durability, aesthetics. We failed more than we succeeded. But eventually, we engineered a bio-composite that's strong, safe, and beautiful.

**Roots isn't a charity project. It's a business model that makes burning obsolete.**

Because when waste has worth, no one burns it.

### Visual
